### The Arbitral tribunal <a href="#olc6u" id="olc6u"></a>

The Arbitral Tribunal is a dispute resolution smart contract that handles subjective disputes that cannot be resolved by code. It does this by having a set of witnesses vote on each dispute to determine the ruling.

### The Witness <a href="#wkkvt" id="wkkvt"></a>

The Witnesses play an important role in the Arbitral Tribunal. When a dispute is filed, it is sent to arbitration, and the Witnesses handle it. They protect trustworthy parties and punish scammers.

### How to be a qualified Witness? <a href="#cdfny" id="cdfny"></a>

To qualify as a Witness, individuals must stake a minimum of 150,000 $ZNT and pass a KYC verification. Professional verification is optional but may be taken into consideration when selecting Witnesses for a particular dispute. Alternatively, individuals may choose to stake a smaller amount of $ZNT in other Witnesses to earn proportional benefits. We believe that this system will help to maintain the integrity of our platform and provide users with a fair and efficient means of resolving disputes.
