Existing spaces like UpWork & Freelance.com successfully solve the challenge of hiring unknown developers as "Freelancers" for a client's project, whilst assuring payment for the work done. Here, they privately act as escrows, and have been doing a fantastic job!

However, some issues still posses:

1. **High Fees**: These platforms tend to charge anywhere from 3-20% of the promised payment as a service charge
2. **Trust**: Trusting in a single organisation always lead to flaws and vulnerabilities
3. **Dispute**: Leaving a single organization to settle executive disputes is a foolish decision
