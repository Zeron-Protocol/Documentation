### About Us <a href="#cextu" id="cextu"></a>

We are a team consisting of four young developers that work for traditional software company. We are using our spare time to try to realize our ideas because of our interest in Web3, and hope the community grows with us.

We are a team of technical professionals seeking support from experienced individuals with expertise in social media operations to join us on a full-time or part-time basis. As we lack experience in this area, your skills and knowledge will be invaluable in helping us achieve our goals. Please consider joining us in this exciting and challenging project.
